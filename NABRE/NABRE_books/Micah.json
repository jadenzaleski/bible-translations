      "4": "The mountains melt under him and the valleys split open, Like wax before the fire, like water poured down a slope.",
      "5": "All this is for the crime of Jacob, for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the crime of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the sin of the house of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?",
      "6": "So I will make Samaria a ruin in the field, a place to plant vineyards; I will throw its stones into the valley, and lay bare its foundations.",
      "7": "All its carved figures shall be broken to pieces, all its wages shall be burned in the fire, and all its idols I will destroy. As the wages of a prostitute it gathered them, and to the wages of a prostitute they shall return.",

      "12": "The inhabitants of Maroth hope for good, But evil has come down from the LORD to the gate of Jerusalem.",
      "13": "Harness steeds to the chariots, inhabitants of Lachish; You are the beginning of sin for daughter Zion, For in you were found the crimes of Israel.",
      "14": "Therefore you must give back the dowry to Moresheth-gath; The houses of Achzib are a dry stream bed to the kings of Israel.",

      "5": "Thus says the LORD regarding the prophets: O you who lead my people astray, When your teeth have something to bite you announce peace, But proclaim war against the one who fails to put something in your mouth.",
      "6": "Therefore you shall have night, not vision, darkness, not divination; The sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be dark for them.",
      "7": "Then the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; They shall all cover their lips, because there is no answer from God.",
