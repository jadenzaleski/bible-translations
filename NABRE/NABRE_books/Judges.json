      "2": "The LORD answered: Judah shall attack: I have delivered the land into his power.",
      "3": "Judah then said to his brother Simeon, “Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, and let us do battle with the Canaanites. I will likewise go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him.",
      "4": "When Judah attacked, the LORD delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their power, and they struck down ten thousand of them in Bezek.",
      "5": "They came upon Adonibezek in Bezek and fought against him. When they struck down the Canaanites and Perizzites,",
      "6": "Adonibezek fled. They pursued him, and when they caught him, they cut off his thumbs and big toes.",
      "7": "“Seventy kings,” said Adonibezek, “used to pick up scraps under my table with their thumbs and big toes cut off. As I have done, so has God repaid me.” He was brought to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
      "8": "The Judahites fought against Jerusalem, captured it, and put it to the sword, setting the city itself on fire.",
      "9": "Afterward the Judahites went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the mountain region, in the Negeb, and in the foothills.",
      "10": "Judah also marched against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron, which was formerly called Kiriath-arba, and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
      "11": "They marched from there against the inhabitants of Debir, which was formerly called Kiriath-sepher.",
      "12": "Caleb said, “To the man who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage.”",
      "13": "Othniel captured it, the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage.",
      "14": "When she came to him, she induced him to ask her father for some land. Then, as she alighted from the donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”",
      "15": "She answered, “Give me a present. Since you have put me in the land of the Negeb, give me pools of water.” So Caleb gave her what she wanted, both the upper and the lower pool.",
      "16": "The descendants of Hobab the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, came up with the Judahites from the City of Palms to the wilderness of Arad, which is in the Negeb, and they settled among the Amalekites.",
      "17": "Then Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they defeated the Canaanites who lived in Zephath. They put the city under the ban and renamed it Hormah.",
      "18": "Judah captured Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, Ekron with its territory, and Ashdod with its territory.",
      "19": "The LORD was with Judah, so they gained possession of the mountain region. But they could not dispossess those who lived on the plain, because they had iron chariots.",
      "20": "As Moses had commanded, they gave Hebron to Caleb, who then drove the three sons of Anak away from there.",
      "21": "As for the Jebusites dwelling in Jerusalem, the Benjaminites did not dispossess them, so that the Jebusites live with the Benjaminites in Jerusalem to the present day.",

      "23": "The house of Joseph reconnoitered Bethel, which formerly was called Luz.",
      "24": "The scouts saw a man coming out of the city and said to him, “Tell us the way into the city, and we will show you mercy.”",
      "25": "He showed them the way into the city, and they put the city to the sword; but they let the man and his whole clan go free.",
      "26": "The man then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.",
      "27": "Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean with its towns or of Taanach with its towns. Nor did they dispossess the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, those of Ibleam and its towns, or those of Megiddo and its towns. The Canaanites continued to live in this district.",
      "28": "When Israel grew stronger, they conscripted the Canaanites as laborers, but did not actually drive them out.",
      "29": "Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, and so the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.",
      "30": "Nor did Zebulun dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron or those of Nahalol; the Canaanites lived among them and became forced laborers.",
      "31": "Nor did Asher dispossess the inhabitants of Acco or those of Sidon, or take possession of Mahaleb, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.",
      "32": "So the Asherites settled among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, for they had not dispossessed them.",
      "33": "Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or those of Beth-anath. They settled among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath became forced laborers for them.",
      "34": "The Amorites hemmed in the Danites in the mountain region, not permitting them to come down onto the plain.",
      "35": "So the Amorites continued to live in Harheres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but as the power of the house of Joseph grew, they were conscripted as laborers.",
      "36": "The territory of the Amorites extended from the Akrabbim pass, from Sela and upward."

      "3": "For I also said, I will not clear them out of your way; they will become traps for you, and their gods a snare for you.",
      "4": "When the messenger of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud.",
      "5": "They named that place Bochim, and they offered sacrifice there to the LORD.",

      "13": "Because they had abandoned the LORD and served Baal and the Astartes,",
      "14": "the anger of the LORD flared up against Israel, and he delivered them into the power of plunderers who despoiled them. He sold them into the power of the enemies around them, and they were no longer able to withstand their enemies.",
      "15": "Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD turned against them, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them; and they were in great distress.",
      "16": "But the LORD raised up judges to save them from the power of their plunderers;",
      "17": "but they did not listen to their judges either, for they prostituted themselves by following other gods, bowing down to them. They were quick to stray from the way their ancestors had taken, who obeyed the commandments of the LORD; but these did not.",
      "18": "When the LORD raised up judges for them, he would be with the judge and save them from the power of their enemies as long as the judge lived. The LORD would change his mind when they groaned in their affliction under their oppressors.",
      "19": "But when the judge died, they would again do worse than their ancestors, following other gods, serving and bowing down to them, relinquishing none of their evil practices or stubborn ways.",
      "20": "The anger of the LORD flared up against Israel, and he said: Because this nation has transgressed my covenant, which I enjoined on their ancestors, and has not listened to me,",
      "21": "I for my part will not clear away for them any more of the nations Joshua left when he died.",
      "22": "They will be made to test Israel, to see whether or not they will keep to the way of the LORD and continue in it as their ancestors did.",

      "4": "These served as a test for Israel, to know whether they would obey the commandments the LORD had enjoined on their ancestors through Moses.",

      "21": "Then Ehud with his left hand drew the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon’s belly.",
      "22": "The hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade because he did not withdraw the dagger from the body.",

      "24": "When Ehud had left and the servants had come, they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, and thought, “He must be easing himself in the cool chamber.”",
      "25": "They waited until they were at a loss when he did not open the doors of the upper room. So they took the key and opened them, and there was their lord lying on the floor, dead.",
      "26": "During their delay Ehud escaped and, passing the sculptured stones, took refuge in Seirah.",
      "27": "On his arrival he sounded the horn in the mountain region of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down from the mountains with him as their leader.",
      "28": "“Follow me,” he said to them, “for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your power.” So they followed him down and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, permitting no one to cross.",
      "29": "On that occasion they slew about ten thousand Moabites, all of them strong warriors. Not one escaped.",
      "30": "So Moab was brought under the power of Israel at that time; and the land had rest for eighty years.",

      "9": "“I will certainly go with you,” she replied, “but you will not gain glory for the expedition on which you are setting out, for it is into a woman’s power that the LORD is going to sell Sisera.” So Deborah arose and went with Barak and journeyed with him to Kedesh.",
      "10": "Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men followed him. Deborah also went up with him.",

      "16": "but Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-ha-goiim. The entire army of Sisera fell beneath the sword, not even one man surviving.",
      "17": "Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin, king of Hazor, and the family of Heber the Kenite.",
      "18": "Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside with me; do not be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a rug.",
      "19": "He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink. I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and then covered him.",
      "20": "“Stand at the entrance of the tent,” he said to her. “If anyone comes and asks, ‘Is there someone here?’ say, ‘No!’”",
      "21": "Jael, wife of Heber, got a tent peg and took a mallet in her hand. When Sisera was in a deep sleep from exhaustion, she approached him stealthily and drove the peg through his temple and down into the ground, and he died.",
      "22": "Then when Barak came in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man you are looking for.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg through his temple.",

      "3": "Her husband then set out with his servant and a pair of donkeys, and went after her to soothe her and bring her back. He arrived at her father’s house, and when the young woman’s father saw him, he came out joyfully to meet him.",
      "4": "His father-in-law, the young woman’s father, urged him to stay, and so he spent three days eating and drinking and passing the night there.",
      "5": "On the fourth day they rose early in the morning and he prepared to go. But the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Fortify yourself with a little food; you can go later on.”",
      "6": "So they stayed and the two men ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the husband, “Why not decide to spend the night here and enjoy yourself?”",
      "7": "The man made a move to go, but when his father-in-law pressed him he went back and spent the night there.",
      "8": "On the fifth morning he rose early to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Fortify yourself!” He coaxed him, and he tarried until the afternoon, and the two of them ate.",
      "9": "Then when the husband was ready to go with his concubine and servant, the young woman’s father said to him, “See, the day is wearing on toward evening. Stay for the night. See, the day is coming to an end. Spend the night here and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow you can start your journey home.”",
      "10": "The man, however, refused to stay another night; he and his concubine set out with a pair of saddled donkeys, and traveled until they came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem.",
      "11": "Since they were near Jebus with the day far gone, the servant said to his master, “Come, let us turn off to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.”",
      "12": "But his master said to him, “We will not turn off to a foreigner’s city, where there are no Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.",
      "13": "Come,” he said to his servant, “let us make for some other place and spend the night in either Gibeah or Ramah.”",
      "14": "So they continued on their way until the sun set on them when they were opposite Gibeah of Benjamin.",
      "15": "There they turned off to enter Gibeah for the night. The man went in and sat down in the town square, but no one took them inside to spend the night.",
      "16": "In the evening, however, an old man came from his work in the field; he was from the mountain region of Ephraim, though he was living in Gibeah where the local people were Benjaminites.",
      "17": "When he noticed the traveler in the town square, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where have you come from?”",
      "18": "He said to him, “We are traveling from Bethlehem of Judah far up into the mountain region of Ephraim, where I am from. I have been to Bethlehem of Judah, and now I am going home; but no one has taken me into his house.",
      "19": "We have straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself and for your maidservant and the young man who is with your servant; there is nothing else we need.”",
      "20": "“Rest assured,” the old man said to him, “I will provide for all your needs, but do not spend the night in the public square.”",
      "21": "So he led them to his house and mixed fodder for the donkeys. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank.",
      "22": "The Outrage at Gibeah. While they were enjoying themselves, the men of the city, a bunch of scoundrels, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They said to the old man who was the owner of the house, “Bring out the man who has come into your house, so that we may get intimate with him.”",
      "23": "The man who was the owner of the house went out to them and said, “No, my brothers; do not be so wicked. This man has come into my house; do not commit this terrible crime.",
      "24": "Instead, let me bring out my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. Humiliate them, or do whatever you want; but against him do not commit such a terrible crime.”",
      "25": "But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and thrust her outside to them. They raped her and abused her all night until morning, and let her go as the sun was coming up.",
      "26": "At the approach of morning the woman came and collapsed at the entrance of the house in which her husband was, and lay there until morning.",
      "27": "When her husband rose in the morning and opened the door of the house to start out again on his journey, there was the woman, his concubine, collapsed at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold.",
      "28": "“Come, let us go,” he said to her, but there was no answer. So the man placed her on a donkey and started out again for home.",
      "29": "On reaching home, he got a knife and took hold of the body of his concubine. He cut her up limb by limb into twelve pieces and sent them throughout the territory of Israel.",
      "30": "He instructed the men whom he sent, “Thus you shall say to all the men of Israel: ‘Has such a thing ever happened from the day the Israelites came up from the land of Egypt to this day? Take note of it; form a plan and give orders.’”"
