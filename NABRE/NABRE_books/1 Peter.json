      "5": "who by the power of God are safeguarded through faith, to a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the final time.",
      "6": "In this you rejoice, although now for a little while you may have to suffer through various trials,",

      "11": "investigating the time and circumstances that the Spirit of Christ within them indicated when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for Christ and the glories to follow them.",
      "12": "It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you with regard to the things that have now been announced to you by those who preached the good news to you [through] the holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels longed to look.",
      "13": "Obedience. Therefore, gird up the loins of your mind, live soberly, and set your hopes completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
      "14": "Like obedient children, do not act in compliance with the desires of your former ignorance",
      "15": "but, as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in every aspect of your conduct,",

      "3": "Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,",
      "4": "but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God.",
      "5": "For this is also how the holy women who hoped in God once used to adorn themselves and were subordinate to their husbands;",
      "6": "thus Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him “lord.” You are her children when you do what is good and fear no intimidation.",
