      "1": "I. The Last Judges, Eli and Samuel Chapter 1 - Elkanah and His Family at Shiloh. There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",
      "2": "He had two wives, one named Hannah, the other Peninnah; Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",
      "3": "Each year this man went up from his city to worship and offer sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were ministering as priests of the LORD.",
      "4": "When the day came for Elkanah to offer sacrifice, he used to give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters,",
      "5": "but he would give a double portion to Hannah because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.",
      "6": "Her rival, to upset her, would torment her constantly, since the LORD had closed her womb.",
      "7": "Year after year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, Peninnah would provoke her, and Hannah would weep and refuse to eat.",
      "8": "Elkanah, her husband, would say to her: “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why are you not eating? Why are you so miserable? Am I not better for you than ten sons?”",
      "9": "Hannah’s Prayer. Hannah rose after one such meal at Shiloh, and presented herself before the LORD; at the time Eli the priest was sitting on a chair near the doorpost of the LORD’s temple.",
      "10": "In her bitterness she prayed to the LORD, weeping freely,",
      "11": "and made this vow: “O LORD of hosts, if you look with pity on the hardship of your servant, if you remember me and do not forget me, if you give your handmaid a male child, I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life. No razor shall ever touch his head.”",
      "12": "As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli watched her mouth,",
      "13": "for Hannah was praying silently; though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. Eli, thinking she was drunk,",
      "14": "said to her, “How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Sober up from your wine!”",
      "15": "“No, my lord!” Hannah answered. “I am an unhappy woman. I have had neither wine nor liquor; I was only pouring out my heart to the LORD.",
      "16": "Do not think your servant a worthless woman; my prayer has been prompted by my deep sorrow and misery.”",
      "17": "Eli said, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have requested.”",
      "18": "She replied, “Let your servant find favor in your eyes,” and left. She went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and no longer appeared downhearted.",
      "19": "Early the next morning they worshiped before the LORD, and then returned to their home in Ramah. When they returned Elkanah had intercourse with his wife Hannah, and the LORD remembered her.",
      "20": "Hannah Bears a Son. She conceived and, at the end of her pregnancy, bore a son whom she named Samuel. “Because I asked the LORD for him.”",
      "21": "The next time her husband Elkanah was going up with the rest of his household to offer the customary sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vows,",
      "22": "Hannah did not go, explaining to her husband, “Once the child is weaned, I will take him to appear before the LORD and leave him there forever.”",
      "23": "Her husband Elkanah answered her: “Do what you think best; wait until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD fulfill his word!” And so she remained at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.",
      "24": "Hannah Presents Samuel to the Lord. Once he was weaned, she brought him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and presented him at the house of the LORD in Shiloh.",
      "25": "After they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the child to Eli.",
      "26": "Then Hannah spoke up: “Excuse me, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here near you, praying to the LORD.",
      "27": "I prayed for this child, and the LORD granted my request.",
      "28": "Now I, in turn, give him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he shall be dedicated to the LORD.” Then they worshiped there before the LORD."

      "11": "When Elkanah returned home to Ramah, the child remained in the service of the LORD under the priest Eli.",
      "12": "Wickedness of Eli’s Sons. Now the sons of Eli were wicked; they had respect neither for the LORD",
      "13": "nor for the priests’ duties toward the people. When someone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork, while the meat was still boiling,",
      "14": "and would thrust it into the basin, kettle, caldron, or pot. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. They treated all the Israelites who came to the sanctuary at Shiloh in this way.",
      "15": "In fact, even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice, “Give me some meat to roast for the priest. He will not accept boiled meat from you, only raw meat.”",
      "16": "And if this one protested, “Let the fat be burned first, then take whatever you wish,” he would reply, “No, give it to me now, or else I will take it by force.”",
      "17": "Thus the young men sinned grievously in the presence of the LORD, treating the offerings to the LORD with disdain.",
      "18": "The Lord Rewards Hannah. Meanwhile the boy Samuel, wearing a linen ephod, was serving in the presence of the LORD.",
      "19": "His mother used to make a little garment for him, which she would bring him each time she went up with her husband to offer the customary sacrifice.",
      "20": "And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, as they were leaving for home. He would say, “May the LORD repay you with children from this woman for the gift she has made to the LORD!”",
      "21": "The LORD favored Hannah so that she conceived and gave birth to three more sons and two daughters, while young Samuel grew up in the service of the LORD.",
      "22": "Eli’s Futile Rebuke. When Eli was very old, he kept hearing how his sons were treating all Israel, and that they were behaving promiscuously with the women serving at the entry of the meeting tent.",
      "23": "So he said to them: “Why are you doing such things? I hear from everyone that your behavior is depraved.",
      "24": "Stop this, my sons! The report that I hear the LORD’s people spreading is not good.",
      "25": "If someone sins against another, anyone can intercede for the sinner with the LORD; but if anyone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for the sinner?” But they disregarded their father’s warning, since the LORD wanted them dead.",
      "26": "Meanwhile, young Samuel was growing in stature and in worth in the estimation of the LORD and the people. The Fate of Eli’s House.",
      "27": "A man of God came to Eli and said to him: “Thus says the LORD: I went so far as to reveal myself to your father’s house when they were in Egypt as slaves to the house of Pharaoh.",
      "28": "I chose them out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priests, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear the ephod in my presence; and I assigned all the fire offerings of the Israelites to your father’s house.",
      "29": "Why do you stare greedily at my sacrifices and at the offerings that I have prescribed? Why do you honor your sons more than you honor me, fattening yourselves with the choicest part of every offering of my people Israel?",
      "30": "This, therefore, is the oracle of the LORD, the God of Israel: I said in the past that your family and your father’s house should minister in my presence forever. But now—oracle of the LORD: Far be it from me! I will honor those who honor me, but those who despise me shall be cursed.",
      "31": "Yes, the days are coming when I will break your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no one in your family lives to old age.",
      "32": "You shall witness, like a disappointed rival, all the benefits enjoyed by Israel, but no member of your household shall ever grow old.",
      "33": "I will leave you one man at my altar to wear out his eyes and waste his strength, but the rest of your family shall die by the sword.",
      "34": "This is a sign for you—what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. Both of them will die on the same day.",
      "35": "I will choose a faithful priest who shall do what I have in heart and mind. I will establish a lasting house for him and he shall serve in the presence of my anointed forever.",

      "17": "Then Eli asked, “What did he say to you? Hide nothing from me! May God do thus to you, and more, if you hide from me a single thing he told you.”",
      "18": "So Samuel told him everything, and held nothing back. Eli answered, “It is the LORD. What is pleasing in the LORD’s sight, the LORD will do.”",

      "2": "So Saul went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand of the best warriors of Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.",
      "3": "Saul camped beside the road on the hill of Hachilah, at the edge of Jeshimon. David, who was living in the wilderness, saw that Saul had come into the wilderness after him",
      "4": "and sent out scouts, who confirmed Saul’s arrival.",
      "5": "David then went to the place where Saul was encamped and saw the spot where Saul and his general, Abner, son of Ner, had their sleeping quarters. Saul was lying within the camp, and all his soldiers were bivouacked around him.",
      "6": "David asked Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai, son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, “Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?” Abishai replied, “I will.”",
      "7": "So David and Abishai reached Saul’s soldiers by night, and there was Saul lying asleep within the camp, his spear thrust into the ground at his head and Abner and his troops sleeping around him.",
      "8": "Abishai whispered to David: “God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Let me nail him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I will not need to strike him twice!”",
      "9": "But David said to Abishai, “Do not harm him, for who can lay a hand on the LORD’s anointed and remain innocent?",
      "10": "As the LORD lives,” David declared, “only the LORD can strike him: either when the time comes for him to die, or when he goes out and perishes in battle.",
      "11": "But the LORD forbid that I lay a hand on the LORD’s anointed! Now take the spear at his head and the water jug, and let us be on our way.”",
      "12": "So David took the spear and the water jug from their place at Saul’s head, and they withdrew without anyone seeing or knowing or awakening. All remained asleep, because a deep slumber from the LORD had fallen upon them.",
      "13": "David Taunts Abner. Crossing over to an opposite slope, David stood on a distant hilltop. With a great distance between them",
      "14": "David called to the army and to Abner, son of Ner, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner shouted back, “Who is it that calls me?”",
      "15": "David said to Abner: “Are you not a man? Who in Israel is your equal? Why were you not guarding your lord the king when one of his subjects came to assassinate the king, your lord?",
      "16": "What you have done is not right. As the LORD lives, you people deserve death because you have not guarded your lord, the anointed of the LORD. Go, look: where are the king’s spear and the water jug that was at his head?”",
      "17": "Saul Admits His Guilt. Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” David answered, “Yes, my lord the king.”",
      "18": "He continued: “Why does my lord pursue his servant? What have I done? What evil am I planning?",
      "19": "Please, now, let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant. If the LORD has incited you against me, may an offering please the LORD. But if it is the people who have done so, may they be cursed before the LORD. They have driven me away so that today I have no share in the LORD’s heritage, but am told: ‘Go serve other gods!’",
      "20": "Do not let my blood spill on the ground far from the presence of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea as if he were hunting partridge in the mountains.”",
      "21": "Then Saul said: “I have done wrong. Come back, David, my son! I will not harm you again, because you considered my life precious today even though I have been a fool and have made a serious mistake.”",
      "22": "But David answered: “Here is the king’s spear. Let an attendant come over to get it.",
      "23": "The LORD repays everyone’s righteousness and faithfulness. Although the LORD delivered you into my hands today, I could not lay a hand on the LORD’s anointed.",
      "24": "Just as I regarded your life as precious today, so may the LORD regard my life as precious and deliver me from all dangers.”",

      "13": "But the king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What do you see?” “I see a god rising from the earth,” she replied.",
      "14": "“What does he look like?” asked Saul. “An old man is coming up wrapped in a robe,” she replied. Saul knew that it was Samuel, and so he bowed his face to the ground in homage.",
      "15": "Saul’s Doom. Samuel then said to Saul, “Why do you disturb me by conjuring me up?” Saul replied: “I am in great distress, for the Philistines are waging war against me and God has turned away from me. Since God no longer answers me through prophets or in dreams, I have called upon you to tell me what I should do.”",
      "16": "To this Samuel said: “But why do you ask me, if the LORD has abandoned you for your neighbor?",

      "4": "But the Philistine commanders were angered at this and said to him: “Send that man back! Let him return to the place you picked out for him. He must not go down into battle with us; during the battle he might become our enemy. For how else can he win back his master’s favor, if not at the expense of our soldiers?",

      "9": "“I recognize,” Achish answered David, “that you are trustworthy, like an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders are saying, ‘He must not go with us into battle.’",
