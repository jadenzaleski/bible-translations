      "5": "But after all this he took to his bed, realizing that he was going to die.",

      "53": "They drove Israel into hiding, wherever places of refuge could be found.",

      "46": "“‘Thus all the people approved of granting Simon the right to act in accord with these decisions,",
      "47": "and Simon accepted and agreed to be high priest, governor, and ethnarch of the Jewish people and priests, and to have authority over all.’”",
      "48": "It was decreed that this inscription should be engraved on bronze tablets, to be set up in a conspicuous place in the precincts of the sanctuary,",
