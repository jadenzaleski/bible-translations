      "1": "Chapter 1 The Desolation of Jerusalem - How solitary sits the city, once filled with people. She who was great among the nations is now like a widow. Once a princess among the provinces, now a toiling slave.",
      "2": "She weeps incessantly in the night, her cheeks damp with tears. She has no one to comfort her from all her lovers; Her friends have all betrayed her, and become her enemies.",
      "3": "Judah has gone into exile, after oppression and harsh labor; She dwells among the nations, yet finds no rest: All her pursuers overtake her in the narrow straits.",
      "4": "The roads to Zion mourn, empty of pilgrims to her feasts. All her gateways are desolate, her priests groan, Her young women grieve; her lot is bitter.",
      "5": "Her foes have come out on top, her enemies are secure; Because the LORD has afflicted her for her many rebellions. Her children have gone away, captive before the foe.",
      "6": "From daughter Zion has gone all her glory: Her princes have become like rams that find no pasture. They have gone off exhausted before their pursuers.",
      "7": "Jerusalem remembers in days of wretched homelessness, All the precious things she once had in days gone by. But when her people fell into the hands of the foe, and she had no help, Her foes looked on and laughed at her collapse.",
      "8": "Jerusalem has sinned grievously, therefore she has become a mockery; Those who honored her now demean her, for they saw her nakedness; She herself groans out loud, and turns away.",
      "9": "Her uncleanness is on her skirt; she has no thought of her future. Her downfall is astonishing, with no one to comfort her. “Look, O LORD, at my misery; how the enemy triumphs!”",
      "10": "The foe stretched out his hands to all her precious things; She has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, Those you forbade to come into your assembly.",
      "11": "All her people groan, searching for bread; They give their precious things for food, to retain the breath of life. “Look, O LORD, and pay attention to how I have been demeaned!",
      "12": "Come, all who pass by the way, pay attention and see: Is there any pain like my pain, which has been ruthlessly inflicted upon me, With which the LORD has tormented me on the day of his blazing wrath?",
      "13": "From on high he hurled fire down into my very bones; He spread out a net for my feet, and turned me back. He has left me desolate, in misery all day long.",
      "14": "The yoke of my rebellions is bound together, fastened by his hand. His yoke is upon my neck; he has made my strength fail. The Lord has delivered me into the grip of those I cannot resist.",
      "15": "All my valiant warriors my Lord has cast away; He proclaimed a feast against me to crush my young men; My Lord has trodden in the wine press virgin daughter Judah.",
      "16": "For these things I weep—My eyes! My eyes! They stream with tears! How far from me is anyone to comfort, anyone to restore my life. My children are desolate; the enemy has prevailed.”",
      "17": "Zion stretches out her hands, with no one to comfort her; The LORD has ordered against Jacob his foes all around; Jerusalem has become in their midst a thing unclean.",
      "18": "“The LORD is in the right; I had defied his command. Listen, all you peoples, and see my pain: My young women and young men have gone into captivity.",
      "19": "I cried out to my lovers, but they failed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city; How desperately they searched for food, to save their lives!",
      "20": "Look, O LORD, at the anguish I suffer! My stomach churns, And my heart recoils within me: How bitter I am! Outside the sword bereaves— indoors, there is death.",
      "21": "Hear how I am groaning; there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies hear of my misery and rejoice over what you have done. Bring on the day you proclaimed, and let them become like me!",
      "22": "Let all their evil come before you and deal with them As you have so ruthlessly dealt with me for all my rebellions. My groans are many, my heart is sick.”"

      "1": "Chapter 2 The Lord’s Wrath and Zion’s Ruin - How the Lord in his wrath has abhorred daughter Zion, Casting down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, Not remembering his footstool on the day of his wrath!",
      "2": "The Lord has devoured without pity all of Jacob’s dwellings; In his fury he has razed daughter Judah’s defenses, Has brought to the ground in dishonor a kingdom and its princes.",
      "3": "In blazing wrath, he cut down entirely the horn of Israel; He withdrew the support of his right hand when the enemy approached; He burned against Jacob like a blazing fire that consumes everything in its path.",
      "4": "He bent his bow like an enemy; the arrow in his right hand Like a foe, he killed all those held precious; On the tent of daughter Zion he poured out his wrath like fire.",
      "5": "The Lord has become the enemy, he has devoured Israel: Devoured all its strongholds, destroyed its defenses, Multiplied moaning and groaning throughout daughter Judah.",
      "6": "He laid waste his booth like a garden, destroyed his shrine; The LORD has blotted out in Zion feast day and sabbath, Has scorned in fierce wrath king and priest.",
      "7": "The Lord has rejected his altar, spurned his sanctuary; He has handed over to the enemy the walls of its strongholds. They shout in the house of the LORD as on a feast day.",
      "8": "The LORD was bent on destroying the wall of daughter Zion: He stretched out the measuring line; did not hesitate to devour, Brought grief on rampart and wall till both succumbed.",
      "9": "Her gates sank into the ground; he smashed her bars to bits. Her king and her princes are among the nations; instruction is wanting, Even her prophets do not obtain any vision from the LORD.",
      "10": "The elders of daughter Zion sit silently on the ground; They cast dust on their heads and dress in sackcloth; The young women of Jerusalem bow their heads to the ground.",
      "11": "My eyes are spent with tears, my stomach churns; My bile is poured out on the ground at the brokenness of the daughter of my people, As children and infants collapse in the streets of the town.",
      "12": "They cry out to their mothers, “Where is bread and wine?” As they faint away like the wounded in the streets of the city, As their life is poured out in their mothers’ arms.",
      "13": "To what can I compare you—to what can I liken you— O daughter Jerusalem? What example can I give in order to comfort you, virgin daughter Zion? For your breach is vast as the sea; who could heal you?",
      "14": "Your prophets provided you visions of whitewashed illusion; They did not lay bare your guilt, in order to restore your fortunes; They saw for you only oracles of empty deceit.",
      "15": "All who pass by on the road, clap their hands at you; They hiss and wag their heads over daughter Jerusalem: “Is this the city they used to call perfect in beauty and joy of all the earth?”",
      "16": "They open their mouths against you, all your enemies; They hiss and gnash their teeth, saying, “We have devoured her! How we have waited for this day— we have lived to see it!”",
      "17": "The LORD has done what he planned. He has fulfilled the threat Decreed from days of old, destroying without pity! He let the enemy gloat over you and exalted the horn of your foes.",
      "18": "Cry out to the Lord from your heart, wall of daughter Zion! Let your tears flow like a torrent day and night; Give yourself no rest, no relief for your eyes.",
      "19": "Rise up! Wail in the night, at the start of every watch; Pour out your heart like water before the Lord; Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, Who collapse from hunger at the corner of every street.",
      "20": "“Look, O LORD, and pay attention: to whom have you been so ruthless? Must women eat their own offspring, the very children they have borne? Are priest and prophet to be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
      "21": "They lie on the ground in the streets, young and old alike; Both my young women and young men are cut down by the sword; You killed them on the day of your wrath, slaughtered without pity.",
      "22": "You summoned as to a feast day terrors on every side; On the day of the LORD’s wrath, none survived or escaped. Those I have borne and nurtured, my enemy has utterly destroyed.”"
