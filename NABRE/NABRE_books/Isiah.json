      "21": "Some of these I will take as priests and Levites, says the LORD.",
      "22": "Just as the new heavens and the new earth which I am making Shall endure before me—oracle of the LORD— so shall your descendants and your name endure.",
      "23": "From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, All flesh shall come to worship before me, says the LORD.",
      "24": "They shall go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against me; For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be extinguished; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."
