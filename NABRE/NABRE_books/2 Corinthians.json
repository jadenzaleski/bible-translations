      "6": "If we are afflicted, it is for your encouragement and salvation; if we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement, which enables you to endure the same sufferings that we suffer.",

For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, with the simplicity and sincerity of God, [and] not by human wisdom but by the grace of God.",

      "14": "Rather, their thoughts were rendered dull, for to this present day the same veil remains unlifted when they read the old covenant, because through Christ it is taken away.",

      "12": "So death is at work in us, but life in you.",
      "13": "Since, then, we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we too believe and therefore speak,",
      "14": "knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence.",

      "16": "Therefore, we are not discouraged; rather, although our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.",
      "17": "For this momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,",

      "5": "Now the one who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a first installment.",

      "12": "We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast of us, so that you may have something to say to those who boast of external appearance rather than of the heart.",
      "13": "For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are rational, it is for you.",
      "14": "For the love of Christ impels us, once we have come to the conviction that one died for all; therefore, all have died.",
      "15": "He indeed died for all, so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.",
      "16": "Consequently, from now on we regard no one according to the flesh; even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no longer.",
